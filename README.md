# Everything-WIll-Be-IK
'Everything Will Be IK' is a robust Inverse Kinematics library For Processing. 
</br></br>
It is based on a generalization of CCD (highly stable), which incorporates elements of FABRIK(highly versatile). 
</br></br>
<b>Features:</b></br>
-Highly stable.</br>
-Multiple end-effector support</br>
-intermediary effector support.</br>
-dampening (stiffness control)</br>
-1-DOF constraints.</br>
-2-DOF constraints. </br>
-3-DOF constraints.</br>

</br>
</br>
The code isn't optimized, but the algorithm is fast that it shouldn't matter for most applications. 
</br>
</br>
Please e-mail me if you find bugs you can't fix. The library is new, so, you might need to work around the occasional null pointer exception. 
</br>
</br>
Better documentation, algorithm outline, and generalized Java library coming soon.
