# Everything-WIll-Be-IK
'Everything Will Be IK' is a robust Inverse Kinematics library For Processing. 

It is based on a generalization of CCD (highly stable), which incorporates elements of FABRIK(highly versatile). 

Features:
-EXTREME stability.
-Multiple end-effectors
-intermediary effectors.
-dampening (stiffness control)
-1-DOF constraints.
-2-DOF constraints.  
-3-DOF constraints.

The code isn't optimized, but the algorithm is fast that it shouldn't matter for most applications. 

Please e-mail me if you find bugs you can't fix. The library is new, so, you might need to work around the occasional null pointer exception. 

Better documentation, algorithm outline, and generalized Java library coming soon.
